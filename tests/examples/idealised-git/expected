1/1: Building IdealisedGit (IdealisedGit.idr)
Usage:
idealised-git  A distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed,
               data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows
  --help  Print this help text.
  add     Add file contents to the index
  clone   Clone a repository into a new directory
  push    Update remote refs along with associated objects
    --force  Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is not an
             ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. This flag disables the
             check. This can cause the remote repository to lose commits; use it
             with care.
