1/1: Building IdealisedGit (IdealisedGit.idr)
Usage:
idealised-git    A distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows
  --help    
  add       Add file contents to the index
  clone     Clone a repository into a new directory
  push      Update remote refs along with associated objects

  --force  Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. This flag disables the check. This can cause the remote repository to lose commits; use it with care.
